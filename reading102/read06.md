**Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS)**
 
 is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.


### CSS color ###
The color code can be one of:
1.**HSL colors**
The HSL color model defines a given color according to its hue, saturation, and lightness components. An optional alpha component represents the color's transparency.

Many designers find HSL more intuitive than RGB, since it allows hue, saturation, and lightness to each be adjusted independently. HSL can also make it easier to create a set of matching colors (such as when you want multiple shades of a single hue).

2.*RGB format: rgb(red, green, blue)*

The RGB color model defines a given color according to its red, green, and blue components. An optional alpha component represents the color's transparency.

Syntax
RGB colors can be expressed through both hexadecimal (prefixed with #) and functional (rgb(), rgba()) notations.

3.**Name format: name(orande,blue,red)**


*Example:*
For orange color:

Hex format: #FFA500

RGB format: rgb(255,165,0)

Name format: orange
