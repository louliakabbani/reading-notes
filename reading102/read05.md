** Comparison Operators in Java**:
Operators are considered to be special characters or symbols that are used to perform certain operations on variables or values (operands). 
In Java, there are several operators that are used to manipulate variables. 
It includes Arithmetic operators, Bitwise operators, Comparison operators, Logical operators, Misc. operators, Assignment operators, etc. 
1. Equal to
This operator checks whether the value on the left side of the operator is equal to the value in the right side.
2. Not equal to
This operator checks whether the value on the left side of the operator is not equal to the value on the right side.
3. Less than
This operator checks whether the value on the left side of the operator is less than the value on the right side.
4. Greater than
This operator checks whether the value on the left side of the operator is greater than the value on the right side.
5. Less than or equal to
This operator checks whether the value on the left side of the operator is less than or equal to the value on the right side
6. Greater than or equal to
This operator checks whether the value on the left side of the operator is greater than or equal to the value on the right side.
 **Logical Operators:**
Logical operators are part of binary operators. 
These operators are specifically used when we are going to combine two or more requirements together. 
These can be used in many conditional and relational expressions.
 On evaluating these conditions, these are the Boolean expressions which give an output of either 1/0 for True/False respectively. 
 **there are different logical operators in  programming language**
1. AND Operator
This operator is symbolized by ‘&&’. This operator gives the true as the output if all the conditions.

2. OR Operator
This is the condition where any one of the given scenario can be true.
3. NOT Operator
This logical operator is usually defined by symbol ‘!’. This operator is equal to “not equal to”.

**Loops in Java**
In programming languages, loops are used to execute a set of instructions/functions repeatedly when some conditions become true.
 There are three types of loops in Java.
1.for loop
2.while loop
3.do-while loop
