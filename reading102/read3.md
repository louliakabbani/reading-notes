HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language.

HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the internet

Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called links

HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images for your internet browser

HTML also provides a basic structure of the page,

the HTML code  is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets 

these are called HTML elements.

Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag.

(The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.)

Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.

Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.
